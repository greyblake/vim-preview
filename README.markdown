# Preview - Vim plugin for previewing markup files
by Sergey Potapov (aka Blake)


## Intro 

Preview plugin is a tool developed to help you to preview markup files such as
.markdown, .rdoc, .textile and .html when you are editing them. It builds
html files and opens them in your browser.


## Supported Formats

The plugin supports the next formats:

* markdown(md, mkd, mkdn, mdown) - depends on `bluecloth` ruby gem
* rdoc - depends on `github-markup` ruby gem
* textile - depends on `RedCloth` ruby gem
* html(htm)
* ronn - depends on `ronn` ruby gem
* reStructuredText(rst) - depends on `RbST` ruby gem and `rst2html` system util


## Dependencies

The plugin requires a builtin ruby interpreter. It means that your Vim
should be compiled with `--enable-rubyinterp` option.
To find out does your Vim have builtin ruby interpreter you can do the next:
    :echo has('ruby')

If output is `1` the ruby interpreter is builtin.

The second thing you should verify is that you have installed all necessary 
ruby gems. Please see "Supported Formats" section to find out what gems you need.

For reStructuredText(rst) format except `RbST` ruby gem you also need `rst2html`.
To get `rst2html` util you probably should install `python-docutils` package. Otherwise PreviewRst vim command will show empty html file.


## Installation

To install the plugin just copy `autoload`, `plugin`, `doc` directories into your .vim directory.


## Usage

* \<Leader\>P - will open current file converted to HTML in your browser.

I want to remind that \<Leader\> in most cases is "\\" key.


## Know bugs

If you found a bug, please report it. Or better send me a pull request:)


## TODO

* Make more unique names for temporary files than just base name ending with `.html`. There should be `vim_preview` prefix, PID of Vim and number of buffer to guarantee avoiding conflicts.
* Add ability to use alternative gems for processing markdown and other formats.
* Handle exception when 'rubygems' is not found.
